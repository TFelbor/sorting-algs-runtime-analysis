  - Runtime measurement functionality
  - Support for different input types:
    - Random arrays
    - Identical value arrays
    - Various array sizes (10,000 to 80,000 elements)
  
  
  ## 4. Algorithm Complexities
  
  - Insertion Sort → O(n²)
  - Bubble Sort → O(n²)
  - Selection Sort → O(n²)
  - Merge Sort → O(n log n)
  - Quick Sort → O(n log n)
  - Stooge Sort → O(n^(log 3/log 1.5)) ≈ O(n^2.7095)
  
  
  ## 5. Usage
  
  ### Basic Usage
  ```
  // Fill array with data
  int[] arr = new int[10000];
  
  // Time and run a sorting algorithm
  long begin = System.currentTimeMillis();
  ManySorts.insertion(arr);  // Or any other sorting method
  long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
  
  System.out.printf("Run time: %fs", (end-begin)/1000.0);
  ```
  
  ### Thread-based Testing
  ```
  // Create and run multiple threads for concurrent testing
  Thread t1 = new Thread(new myThread());
  t1.start();
  ```
  
  
  ## 6. Testing Scenarios
  
  1. **Random Data**
     - Arrays filled with random integers
     - Tests general-case performance
  
  2. **Identical Values**
     - Arrays filled with the same value
     - Tests best-case scenarios
  
  3. **Multi-threaded Testing**
     - Concurrent execution of sorting algorithms
     - Tests performance under parallel conditions
  
  
  ## 7. Performance Analysis
  
  The project allows for performance analysis of sorting algorithms under different conditions:
  - Different input sizes
  - Different input patterns
  - Single vs Multi-threaded execution
  
  
  ## 8. Implementation Details
  
  - All sorting algorithms are implemented as static methods
  - Thread implementation uses the Runnable interface
  - Runtime measurements use System.currentTimeMillis()
  - Array sizes are configurable for different test scenarios
  
  
  ## 9. Requirements
  
  - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
  - Sufficient memory to handle large arrays (up to 80,000 elements)
  
  
  ## 10. Potential Improvements
  
  - Additional sorting algorithms
  - Visualization of sorting process
  - More detailed performance metrics
  - CSV output for data analysis
  - Memory usage analysis
  - GUI for interactive testing
